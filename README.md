This is a **meal delivery service front page**. This project was created as part of [Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/) by *Jonas Schmedtmann*.

The HTML and CSS for this project were written by me alongside the course instructor as a learning experience. This project does not include any Javascript. The focus is on the design of the page and the user experience.


### This page features the following:

- A powerful *hero section* to draw the attention and immediately call the user to action with color focus on the buttons that generate business
- A *featured in section* to convey brand trust and support from well-known reviews
- Effective use of white space to create a seamless flow from one section to the next without overwhelming the user
- Balanced use of icons and images to create a professional feel without boring the user
- A consistent color theme throughout the page to establish brand identity and cohesion
- A well-organized footer section that has both functionality and professional feel
